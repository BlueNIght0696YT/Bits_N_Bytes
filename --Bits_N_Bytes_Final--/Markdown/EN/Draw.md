## Draw (Drawing)
On our dashboard BitsNBytes you may have noticed that there is an option to draw and display geometric shapes. This explanation page should clear up all your questions about it. So let me introduce you to a guide on how to use and customize Draw.

### How to use
## Calling
Like any other option on our dashboard, it can be called from the Options/Tools menu. The Options/Tools menu is opened by right-clicking anywhere on the page, assuming it is not a widget. To access the Draw panel, you need to do the following: click Tools > Creations > Draw. Now, in a new tab, the widget will open on your screen. 

## Draw
Now you can draw on the white area with your mouse or finger.

## Tools
On the left side you can select your desired tool, the brush thickness and the filled function. 

## Colors
It has predefined colors and there is a color picker at the rightmost color field. 

## Clear
With the button "Clear Canvas" you can delete the drawn content.
Attention! Deleted content cannot be restored!

## Save
With the button "Save as Image" you can download the drawn content as .JPG file.ss
